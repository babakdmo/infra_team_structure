## 🔧 Owns:
- HDFS
- YARN
- Airflow
- Spark
- ZooKeeper
- Kafka  
(All deployed and managed on Kubernetes)

## 🧩 Core Responsibilities

### 1. Service Deployment & Upgrades
- Package and deploy services using Helm charts or Operators:
  - HDFS NameNode/DataNode
  - Spark Operator
  - Airflow with KubernetesExecutor
  - Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters
- Plan and execute **rolling upgrades** for Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow to ensure **zero downtime**.

### 2. Configuration & Tuning
- Tune HDFS replication, JVM GC settings for NameNode.
- Configure Spark executor memory and core settings.
- Tune Airflow parallelism and DAG concurrency.
- Manage YARN queue capacities and scheduler settings (FIFO vs FAIR).

### 3. Security & Access
- Integrate FreeIPA/Kerberos inside Kubernetes pods for HDFS/YARN auth.
- Issue and rotate TLS certs for internal services.
- Apply Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for inter-service access control.

### 4. Observability & Alerting
- Deploy Prometheus exporters for:
  - HDFS
  - YARN
  - Spark
- Set up Grafana dashboards and Loki/EFK for logging.
- Define alerts for:
  - Disk saturation
  - Failed jobs
  - Scheduler throughput drops

### 5. Backup, Recovery & Disaster Recovery (DR)
- Automate:
  - HDFS NameNode metadata snapshots (fsimage/JN edits)
  - Airflow DB dumps
- Script:
  - NameNode failover
  - ZooKeeper quorum recovery
- Quarterly test of restore and recovery processes.
