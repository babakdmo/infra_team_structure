- Plan and execute **rolling upgrades** for Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow to ensure **zero downtime**.

### 2. Configuration & Tuning
- Tune HDFS replication, JVM GC settings for NameNode.
- Configure Spark executor memory and core settings.
- Tune Airflow parallelism and DAG concurrency.
- Manage YARN queue capacities and scheduler settings (FIFO vs FAIR).

### 3. Security & Access
- Integrate FreeIPA/Kerberos inside Kubernetes pods for HDFS/YARN auth.
- Issue and rotate TLS certs for internal services.
- Apply Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for inter-service access control.

### 4. Observability & Alerting
- Deploy Prometheus exporters for:
  - HDFS
  - YARN
  - Spark
- Set up Grafana dashboards and Loki/EFK for logging.
- Define alerts for:

# **Data Engineering Team**

## ðŸ§¾ Team Summary

| Area | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Scope** | Batch and stream ingestion into data lakehouses; first-class ETL/ELT transforms to storage cluster |
| **Pipeline Types** | Batch and stream pipelines (PySpark + Spark SQL) for ingestion and pre-warehouse transformations |
| **CI/CD** | GitLab CI for DAG validation, job tests, image builds, and GitOps deployment |
| **Lineage & Metadata** | DataHub for column-level lineage, usage tracking, schema registry, and ownership tagging |
| **Quality** | Great Expectations checks, freshness validation, SLA-based alerts |
| **On-Call** | PagerDuty-based rotation for failure handling and SLA violations |

---

## ðŸ”§ Owns:
- Batch and stream ingestion jobs
- PySpark & Spark SQL-based transformation pipelines
- Airflow DAGs for orchestration
- GitLab CI pipelines for continuous delivery
- Great Expectations suites for validation
- DataHub for end-to-end lineage and metadata
- Lakehouse table formats (Iceberg) and catalogs (Hive Metastore, Nessie)

---

## ðŸ§© Core Responsibilities

### 1. Batch & Stream Ingestion (Lakehouse Load)
- Ingest ETL/ELT data from batch and stream sources directly into the data lakehouse.
- Operate and maintain Kafka Connect clusters and Debezium connectors for real-time CDC.
- Detect schema drift, log changes, and trigger upstream notifications via GitLab issues.

### 2. First-Class Transformations
- Use **PySpark** and **Spark SQL** to perform scalable, first-class transformations during ingestion.
- Enrich, deduplicate, and validate data before it is written to Iceberg-based lakehouse tables.
- Design and manage schema evolution and partitioning strategies in **Iceberg** using **Hive Metastore** and **Project Nessie** catalogs.

### 3. Workflow Orchestration
- Author robust **Apache Airflow DAGs** supporting backfills, SLAs, retries, branching, and parametrization.
- Automate validation, testing, and deployment of pipelines using **GitLab CI** and **GitOps** practices.

### 4. Data Quality & Lineage
- Define and execute **Great Expectations** checks for completeness, accuracy, and business rules.
- Use **DataHub** to register lineage and metadata from PySpark, Spark SQL, dbt, and Airflow pipelines.
- Enforce structured metadata: ownership, sensitivity tagging, and field-level masking policies.

### 5. Monitoring & SLA Enforcement
- Track pipeline metrics like lag, freshness, and row volumes via **Prometheus**.
- Trigger alerts using custom **PrometheusRules** and **Alertmanager** integrations.
- Respond to incidents with a documented on-call process, runbooks, and postmortem workflows.
