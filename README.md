# ✅ Why Organizing into Four 2-Person Subteams Works Better

---

###  Benefits of Creating Focused Subteams

- **Clear Responsibilities = Faster Problem Resolution**  
  - Each subteam owns a specific area (like platform infrastructure, ML, pipelines, or BI). When something goes wrong, it’s clear who handles it, no delays or confusion.

- **Focused Expertise with Built-in Collaboration**  
  - Engineers can specialize in one domain and develop deep skills, while working closely with a teammate to share context and knowledge.

- **Multiple Projects Move Forward at the Same Time**  
  - Different subteams can work on different priorities without getting in each other’s way—like fixing Spark configs while also launching a new Superset dashboard.

- **Structured Mentoring and Career Growth**  
  - Pairing a less experienced engineer with a more experienced one makes it easier to learn and grow—without needing formal managers for each subteam.

- **Better Resilience to Leave or Turnover**  
  - If someone takes vacation or leaves, their teammate can continue the work. The rest of the team stays productive and unaffected.

- **Flexible and Easy to Grow**  
  - As your team expands, you can add people into each subteam without needing to change how the whole team is organized.

- **Supports Future Business Needs**  
  - If your company later offers parts of the data platform (ML, BI, pipelines) as services to other teams or clients, these subteams already match those service boundaries.

---

### Why This Team Structure Is the Right Choice

Organizing into focused subteams provides:

- **Clear accountability** – Everyone knows who is responsible for each system or service.
- **Faster progress** – More projects can be delivered in parallel without conflicts.
- **Strong reliability** – You always have backup; work doesn’t stop when someone is away.
- **Higher skill levels** – Engineers improve faster by working in a consistent area.
- **Future readiness** – Easy to scale, extend, or align with company-wide products.

This structure creates a clear, resilient, and scalable team that delivers more—without chaos or delays.

# 🌳 Leadership Structure

This structure shows how an 8-person data infrastructure team is organized under a single team lead, with four specialized subteams. Each subteam currently has two members and operates without a designated subteam lead.

```


---

### Leadership Rules

#### Current Phase: Flat Subteams (2 Members Each)
- No subteam leads yet.
- All 8 engineers report directly to the **Data Infrastructure Lead**.

---

##### Promotion Rule: Subteam Lead When Team Reaches 3 People
- When any subteam grows to **3 or more engineers**, assign a **subteam lead**.
- The subteam lead will:
  - Coordinate day-to-day tasks within the team.
  - Mentor junior members.
  - Represent the team in planning and reviews.
- Subteam leads **are not managers**, but **technical points of contact**.

---

### Responsibilities of the Data Infrastructure Lead
---

#### Organizational Leadership

- **Performance Management**  
  - Conduct regular 1:1s, track individual contributions, and manage performance reviews using clear and consistent evaluation criteria.

- **Shape Up Process Ownership**  
  - Own and lead the Shape Up process within the team—define appetites, pitch high-leverage projects, and guide cycle planning. Ensure pitches are technically feasible and strategically aligned.

- **Mentorship & Career Growth**  
  - Actively support engineers’ professional development through structured growth plans, skill mapping, and feedback loops.

- **Conflict Resolution**  
  - Resolve prioritization or ownership disputes and ensure collaboration across all subteams stays constructive and timely.

- **Cross-Team and Stakeholder Communication**  
  - Act as the main point of contact between the data infrastructure team and other internal teams. Maintain visibility and transparency of work progress, timelines, and delivery risks.

- **On-Call Ownership and Escalation**  
  - Define and manage the on-call rotation, escalation policy, and post-incident review process. Ensure 24/7 coverage across critical systems and coordinate timely resolution of Sev-1 incidents.

---

#### Technical Leadership

- **Architecture Design & Approval**  
  - Lead the design of major components such as secure data lakes, streaming pipelines, ML infra, and analytics stack integrations. Approve proposals and enforce architectural standards.

- **Technical Roadmap Ownership**  
  - Maintain and evolve a unified technical roadmap that feeds into Shape Up pitches, including items like Spark upgrades, Iceberg adoption, ML/LLM stack enhancements, and query federation.

- **Design Technical Solutions**  
  - Participate in designing key systems such as CDC pipelines, ML model deployment flows, Spark-on-YARN optimizations, or security integration patterns.

- **Guide and Participate in Implementation**  
  - Where possible, contribute directly to coding, Helm chart updates, infrastructure automation, or architecture prototyping—especially in high-risk or early-phase work.

- **Review and Monitor Technical Progress**  
  - Run tech check-ins during build cycles, review branch progress, and ensure scopes are being completed with the expected quality and performance.

- **Ensure System Reliability and Security**  
  - Own on-call policy, SLA tracking, TLS/SSO/Kerberos enforcement, and root-cause analysis of platform incidents.

- **Budget and Capacity Planning**  
  - Manage infrastructure costs (GPUs, storage, HP Servers), align spending with Shape Up cycle priorities, and ensure system capacity keeps up with forecasted demand.

# ✅ Why the Data Team—Not DevOps—Should Own the Data Platform

---

### Key Reasons for Data Platform Ownership

| # | Core Reason | How It Works in Practice |
|---|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Platform decisions must reflect data logic | Engine-level configs (like shuffle partitions or memory allocation) need awareness of data structure and usage patterns |
| 2 | Workload-aware tuning | Data engineers understand query shapes and can adjust Spark/Presto/Pinot accordingly |
| 3 | Cost optimization with full context | Only the data team can link execution metrics (like scan size or shuffle bytes) to specific jobs, tables, and features |
| 4 | End-to-end incident resolution | Data Infra can debug and solve issues from DAGs and configs down to JVM flags and engine-level metrics |
| 5 | Security and compliance expertise | Kerberos, TLS for Iceberg REST, and SSO integration require domain-specific understanding of engine auth flows |
| 6 | Proven best practice across top tech companies | Google, Netflix, Uber, and Meta all keep data platform operations inside their data org—not outside of it |

---

### Summary

Letting the Data Infrastructure team run and tune the data platform results in:

- Platform decisions rooted in query and pipeline behavior  
- Faster, more precise incident handling  
- Better cost control tied to data usage  
- Fewer communication handoffs during troubleshooting  
- Alignment with how the most effective companies run their stack
